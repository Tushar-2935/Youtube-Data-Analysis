1. Data Collection:
The code uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve information from multiple YouTube channels like TechTFQ, MrBeast, PewDiePie, SET India, and T-Series.
It gathers statistics such as channel name, subscriber count, total views, number of videos, and playlist ID for each channel.
2. Data Transformation:
The channel statistics are stored in a Pandas DataFrame, where data types are converted to ensure that numerical values (like subscribers, views, and videos) are in the correct format.
3. Data Visualization:
The code uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations, such as bar plots, to compare different statistics like subscriber count and total views across the channels.

This project explores YouTube video data to analyze trends in views, likes, comments, and categories. The goal is to identify factors driving video success, optimize content strategies, and provide insights into audience engagement using visualizations and statistical analysis.
